## About

Hello, my name is Nolan Wilkins and I'm a Computer Science major who goes to The University of North Texas and will graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Spring 2027, but I'm planning on getting a masters.

I'm planning in either having a career related to Software Development or Artificial Intelligence.

Throughout highschool I took almost all of the Computer Science related classes, including Computer Science 1-3, 2 being AP Computer Science, Video Game Programming 1-2, and Mobile Application Development. I also made a mod for the game ROUNDS that has over 66 thousand downloads. 

I'm looking to build my network and generally get job experience. 

I've never had a traditional job, but during my junior year of high school, I enrolled in a class called Culinary Arts. This class provided a hands-on experience simulating various aspects of real employment, including tasks like cleaning, dishwashing, catering, and working as a cashier. Surprisingly, we had minimal guidance throughout these activities, and we even got community service hours if we asked for it. If you'd like more details, please feel free to ask.
